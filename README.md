# StartWithVehicles

WIP - currently first release v0.1.0 with cheaper trains implemented  

This mod aims to provide the player with access to cheap vehicles and trains in Tier 1, for those who prefer to build with vehicle logistics from the beginning rather than later in the game. This mod was conceptualized to fill the gap in its purpose left by the now discontinued X3 Better Vehicles mod.
